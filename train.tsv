please find the frequent itemsets in the data	associationRules
Which are the characteristics that mostly influence the %LABEL%?	associationRules ( %LABEL% )
What is related to the %LABEL%?	correlation ( %LABEL% )
If %F%, is she prone to have %LABEL%?	featureSelection ( %F% ,  %LABEL% ) correlation

do you find anomalies?	outliersDetection
can you predict if there is a person that will have %LABEL%?	classification (  %LABEL% )
i want you to predict %LABEL% according to the features %F% , %F%	featureSelection ( %F%, %F% ) classification ( %LABEL% )
i want you to predict %LABEL% according to the features %F% , %F% , %F% , %F%	featureSelection ( %F% , %F% , %F% , %F% ) classification ( %LABEL% )
can you remove the %F%  and only after it predict the %LABEL%	featureRemoval (%F%) classification
